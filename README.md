## **Design Choices**


### **Fonts**

The fonts were chosen to complement one another and also give the aesthetic of a fun, knitting store with ['Lobster', cursive](static/docs/images/lobster.png) and ['Libre Franklin', sans-serif](static/docs/images/libre.png) as a contrasting font to help the cursive stand out and allow for extra readability when more information given.



### **Colours**

- ![](static/docs/images/ms4-coolors.png) This Coolors palette was used to put together a colour scheme to reflect the different colours of the balls of wool to keep in with the theme of the knitting shop. 
- The original colour scheme was slightly different but due to accessibility reasons this was changed near the end of building this project to improve contrast ratios. Previous colours [here]((static/docs/images/knit-happens-coolors.png)) 

### **Imagery**

The images used were taken from these sources:
- Home page wallpaper by [Nynne Schr√∏der](https://unsplash.com/photos/nMdC42MrwN8)
- The images of the different kinds and colours of wool were from [Surene Palvie](https://www.pexels.com/@surene-palvie-1075224) 
- The images of knitted garments from [Miriam Alonso](https://www.pexels.com/@miriam-alonso), [Anna Khomutova](https://www.pexels.com/@anna-khomutova-3562984), [Karolina Grabowska](https://www.pexels.com/@karolina-grabowska), [Arina Krasnikova](https://www.pexels.com/@arina-krasnikova) and [Daria Shevtsova](https://www.pexels.com/@daria)

### **Error Pages**

#### *404.html*

 - 404 page created to redirect users back to the main site in case of an error

#### *403.html*

 - 403 page created to redirect users back to the main site in case they try to access a page they are not authorised to

#### *500.html*

 - 500 error page created to redirect users to the main site after a server error

### **Future Features**

- When user logs out their bag is emptied so that when they log bag in the existing items would be in their bag from the previous log in. I would implement a feature where this was saved to the profile. 
- The ability for users to change their username
- A star rating or upvote functionality for the products and blog posts.

### **Responsive Design**

The site was designed to be mobile first as more users are using their handheld devices to shop online but this has been adapted to allow a great experience for desktop users also. 

### **Defensive Design**

- **Form Validation**
  - Form validation has been added to every form to ensure all required information is included before submitting.
  - If incorrect data is input a warning text appears to advise the user how to continue

- **Default Image if none added**
  - In the event that a product or blog post is added without an image a default image will be added.
- **Unauthorised Attempts**
  - An [error](static/docs/images/error.png) is launched if the user attempts to visit a part of the site where they are not authorised 
- **@login_required**
  - @login_required decorator added to restrict access to certain pages.
      - If a logged-out user tries to access a restricted page, they will be redirected to the login page.
      - Only authorised users may perform certain actions: Eg add, edit, delete product and edit, delete blog posts. [Example](static/docs/images/not-post-author.png)
- **Bag**
  - Validation ensures a minimum of 0 product and maximum of 99 products is added to the bag. In the case that 0 is selected the item is removed from the bag.
  - Error message appears if user tries to add negative numbers of items "Value must be greater than or equal to 0"

## **Database**

- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
    - Cloud based database to hold the product, user, order and blog fields.
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### **Database Design**

The database uses SQL through PostgreSQL and were originally formed from fixtures [*categories.json*](products/fixtures/categories.json) and [*products.json*](products/fixtures/products.json)

The Database schema is below

## **Testing**

- Testing can be found [here](TESTING.md)

## **Bugs**


### Bugs Fixed 

- Fix for [Favicon 401 error](https://medium.com/@aurelien.delogu/401-error-on-a-webmanifest-file-cb9e3678b9f3) found as resolved using the site linked.
<!-- - Bug using [Bulma columns](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/449) creates overflow on mobile as there is margin top, left and right of 0.75rem so addressed this in CSS using margin: 0 !important; on columns. -->
- Fix for price negative numbers on Add Product page form found on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12384460/allow-only-positive-decimal-numbers)


### Known Bugs
- AllAuth automatically logs user out before displaying Sign Out page
- Sorting products works on first page but when clicking next page it stops working.


## **Version Control**

**Version control** was managed within **GitHub** and **Gitpod** and regular commits pushed to **GitHub**. 
See below for how this was managed:

### Gitpod Workspaces
1. Starting from GitHub clone the [Code Institute template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) by clicking Use This Template and copying to my repository under the name ms1-ali-shiatsu. The workspace is then launched by clicking GitPod - this action only needs to be performed once and then workspace reopened from GitPod.
2. Start the Gitpod Workspace which opens an **online IDE editor** window.

### Gitpod branching and committing to GitHub
1. I created various branches to work on different sections of code to push to master. I did this by typing into the terminal the commands: *git status* to find out which branch currently on; *git switch -c <*branchname*>* to create a new branch and switch to it immediately and then once the work was completed on that branch typed *git add <*files to be added*>* , *git commit -m <*commit message*>* and *git push --set-upstream <*remote*> <*branchname*>* to push to GitHub. I then created a pull request to pull the changes to the master if happy with the changes. From this point I would use *git -d <*branchname*>* to delete the local branch and delete the remote branch on GitHub. 
2. Meaningful commit messages were used to allow to roll back any changes made throughout the journey.

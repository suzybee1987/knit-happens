## **Testing**

## **Version Control**

**Version control** was managed within **GitHub** and **Gitpod** and regular commits pushed to **GitHub**. 
See below for how this was managed:

### Gitpod Workspaces
1. Starting from GitHub clone the [Code Institute template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) by clicking Use This Template and copying to my repository under the name ms1-ali-shiatsu. The workspace is then launched by clicking GitPod - this action only needs to be performed once and then workspace reopened from GitPod.
2. Start the Gitpod Workspace which opens an **online IDE editor** window.

### Gitpod branching and committing to GitHub
1. I created various branches to work on different sections of code to push to master. I did this by typing into the terminal the commands: *git status* to find out which branch currently on; *git switch -c <*branchname*>* to create a new branch and switch to it immediately and then once the work was completed on that branch typed *git add <*files to be added*>* , *git commit -m <*commit message*>* and *git push --set-upstream <*remote*> <*branchname*>* to push to GitHub. I then created a pull request to pull the changes to the master if happy with the changes. From this point I would use *git -d <*branchname*>* to delete the local branch and delete the remote branch on GitHub. 
2. Meaningful commit messages were used to allow to roll back any changes made throughout the journey.
